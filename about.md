### About Me

Howdy! I am Swaroop. I love meeting new people and get to know their culture and traditions. One of my dream travelling countries include Switzerland. I work on open source technologies and a [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) fan! I use Ubuntu and the xfce4 desktop environment on my machine. xfce's sleek and elegant design and is simply amazing and I feel very comfortable working on it!  I am current pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications in Bangalore, IN. I am also a music lover and a guitarist!

I run a blog at [wordpress](http://zwaroop.wordpress.com), but I was unhappy because it was inflexible to my customization needs. So a friend of mine [Vipin Nair](http://swvist.github.com) suggested me to use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for blogging but was unsure. 

[Github](http://github.com) has always helped me to store all my projects and facilitate social coding. And the thing that I was most impressed was, Vipin told me that you can have a complete blog built using jekyll and host it via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). [Dayanand Prabhu](https://twitter.com/NotSoSleepy) also gave an excellent talk on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) at [Barcamp XII](http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb/) which was really inspiring.

[Github](http://github.com) simply rocks! So I finally decided to start blogging using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This [site](http://swaroopsm.github.com) is completely built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [source code](https://github.com/swaroopsm/swaroopsm.github.com) is open-sourced at [GitHub](http://github.com).

#### Happy Coding!
