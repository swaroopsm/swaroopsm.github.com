<h3> About Me </h3>
<hr>
<p>Howdy! I am Swaroop. I love meeting new people and get to know their culture and traditions. One of my dream travelling countries include Switzerland. I work on open source technologies and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> fan! I use Ubuntu and the xfce4 desktop environment on my machine. xfce's sleek and elegant design is simply amazing and I feel very comfortable working in it!  I am current pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications in Bangalore, IN. I am also a music lover and a guitarist!</p>

<p>I run a blog at <a href="http://zwaroop.wordpress.com">wordpress</a>, but I was unhappy because it was inflexible to my customization needs. So a friend of mine <a href="http://swvist.github.com">Vipin Nair</a> suggested me to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> for blogging but I was unsure. </p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> has always helped me to host all my projects source files and facilitate social coding. And the thing that I was most impressed was, Vipin told me that you can have a complete blog built using jekyll and host it via <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/NotSoSleepy">Dayanand Prabhu</a> also gave an excellent talk on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> at <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb/">Barcamp XII</a> which was really inspiring.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> simply rocks! So I finally decided to start blogging using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>. This <a href="http://swaroopsm.github.com">site</a> is completely built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/swaroopsm/swaroopsm.github.com">source code</a> is open-sourced at <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>.

<h5>Happy Coding!</h5>
